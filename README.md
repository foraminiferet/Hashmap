# HashMap Implementation in Ruby

This project provides a simple implementation of a hash map (or hash table) using a linked list for collision resolution. The hash map supports basic operations such as inserting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs, as well as checking for the existence of keys.

## Features

- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically resizes when the load factor exceeds a specified threshold.
- **Collision Handling**: Utilizes linked lists to handle collisions.
- **Key and Value Storage**: Stores pairs of keys and values, with the option to have `nil` values.
- **Basic Operations**: Supports `set`, `get`, `remove`, `has?`, and utility methods to retrieve keys, values, and entries.
